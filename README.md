# tsml-py

A toolkit for time series machine learning algorithms.

Please see [`tsml_eval`](https://github.com/time-series-machine-learning/tsml-eval) and
[`aeon`](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon) for more developed packages. This package
is more of a sandbox for testing out new ideas and algorithms. It may contain some
algorithms and implementations that are not available in the other toolkits.

The current release of `tsml` is v0.4.0.

## Installation

`tsml` is available on PyPI and can be installed via pip:

```console
pip install tsml
```
